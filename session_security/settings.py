"""
Settings for django-session-security.

WARN_AFTER
    Time (in seconds) before the user should be warned that is session will
    expire because of inactivity. Default 540. Overridable in
    ``settings.SESSION_SECURITY_WARN_AFTER``.

EXPIRE_AFTER
    Time (in seconds) before the user should be logged out if inactive. Default
    is 600. Overridable in ``settings.SESSION_SECURITY_EXPIRE_AFTER``.

PASSIVE_URLS
    List of urls that should be ignored by the middleware. For example the ping
    ajax request of session_security is made without user intervention, as such
    it should not be used to update the user's last activity datetime.
    Overridable in ``settings.SESSION_SECURITY_PASSIVE_URLS``.

PASSIVE_URL_NAMES
    Same as PASSIVE_URLS, but takes Django URL names instead of a path. This
    is useful in case path names change, or contain parameterized values, and
    thus cannot be described statically. NOTE: currently namespaces are not
    handled. Overridable in ``settings.SESSION_SECURITY_PASSIVE_URL_NAMES``.

LOGOUT_MESSAGE
    Message that will be shown after user has been logged out. Works using Django
    messages framework. Default is ``None``, so no message will be added to the
    request. Overridable in ``settings.SESSION_SECURITY_LOGOUT_MESSAGE``.

SESSION_SECURITY_INSECURE
    Set this to True in your settings if you want the project to run without
    having to set SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE=True, which you should
    because it makes no sense to use this app with
    ``SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE`` to False.
