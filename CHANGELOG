2.1.1

    - Fixed AUTHORS,
    - Added utils to full documentation.
    - Promoted to Production/Stable.

2.1.0

    - Django 1.5 and 1.6 support.
    - Fix #6: Internet Explorer 8 support.
    - Python 3.3 support.
    - Minor BC break: we can't set datetime objects directly in the session
      since django 1.6. Instead, we go through session_security.utils functions
      get_last_activity() and set_last_activity(). If you were touching
      session['_session_security'] directly, you should update your code to use
      those functions.

2.0.5 Removed more debug statements.

2.0.4 Fix #4: Removed debug statement.
